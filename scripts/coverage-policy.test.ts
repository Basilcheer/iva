// Node's native include globs filter loaded modules; they do not load untouched files.
// This test pins the exact production path inventory and a separately measured 26-path
// blind-spot snapshot. It does not determine what the current import graph loads, claim
// that the other paths are reported, or notice import-graph changes without path changes.
// Measured again for this inventory: the web inbound-gate round added `agent/lib/web-gate.ts`
// and `agent/tools/web_fetch.ts`, both reported, and gave `agent/tools/web_search.ts` its
// first loading test - so the blind spot dropped from 26 paths to 25. The subagent slots
// `agent/subagents/planner/tools/web_fetch.ts` and `web_search.ts` came next, both reported
// at 100% by scripts/web-surface-gate.test.ts, so the blind spot stays at 25. The per-node
// sandbox pin `agent/subagents/planner/sandbox.ts` came after it: measured unreported, like
// the root `agent/sandbox.ts` it re-exports - no test loads either - so the blind spot is 26.
// The notice policy module `scripts/lib/notice-policy.ts` and the `/menu` screen that switches
// the reports, `scripts/lib/menu/notices.ts`, came next - both loaded by their own tests and
// reported, so the blind spot stayed at 26. The provider resolver `agent/lib/model-provider.ts`
// came after them, reported at 100% by its own test. Its integration test also settled a
// standing claim about `agent/hooks/usage.ts`: a spawned child inherits NODE_V8_COVERAGE, so
// the hook it imports is measured like any other file - re-measured at 82% lines here, which
// takes it off this list and puts the blind spot at 25. The turn-cancellation seam came next -
// `agent/lib/eve-cancel.ts`, `agent/lib/telegram-cancel-route.ts` and
// `agent/lib/telegram-cancel-client.ts` - all three loaded by `scripts/lib/telegram-cancel.test.ts`
// and reported, so the blind spot stays at 25. The webhook-mode Stop handler
// `agent/lib/telegram-stop.ts` came last, loaded by `scripts/telegram-failure-events.test.ts`
// through the real channel and reported, so the blind spot stays at 25. The memory resolver
// `scripts/lib/memory-mode.ts` came next, loaded and reported by its own test
// (`scripts/lib/memory-mode.test.ts`), so the blind spot stays at 25. The Reminder CLI
// `scripts/cli/remind.ts` followed, reported by its own test, so it stays at 25. The live skill
// resolver came last: `agent/lib/custom-skills.ts` (99% lines) and `agent/lib/data-dir.ts` (100%)
// are loaded and reported by their own tests, while the slot file `agent/skills/custom.ts` is
// loaded by eve alone - measured unreported, like `agent/sandbox.ts` - so the blind spot is 26.
