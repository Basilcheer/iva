# TLA+ models

The repository keeps bounded models of the lock, the night writer, restart recovery and proactive notices. Run them from a temporary directory because TLC writes state files beside the model.

## FileLock

`FileLock.tla` models the directory lock, owner token, heartbeat, stale takeover, crashes and bounded event-loop delay. The configurations vary process count, stale interval, deadline and synchronous holders:

- `FileLock.cfg`
- `FileLock-2p.cfg`
- `FileLock-deadline.cfg`
- `FileLock-hold.cfg`
- `FileLock-lag.cfg`
- `FileLock-slow.cfg`
- `FileLock-sync-slow.cfg`
- `FileLock-witness.cfg`

Example:

```sh
d=$(mktemp -d)
cp specs/FileLock.tla specs/FileLock.cfg "$d"/
(cd "$d" && tlc -workers 2 -deadlock -config FileLock.cfg FileLock.tla)
```

The model assumes that a live asynchronous holder's event loop runs often enough to refresh the lock before the stale threshold. A fully stopped process can still lose the lock after that threshold. Filesystem errors and unknown directory members are outside the model and covered by executable tests.

## NightWriter

`NightWriter.tla` models one writer under the memory lock: a model call whose answer is cached before any write, a whole-section replacement guarded by the file hash read for the call, an owner edit racing the night, commit-gated readiness, a crash at any step and restart, and an ordered queue of days. On a hash mismatch nothing is written, the answer is dropped, the Card gets `truth_pending` and the day still closes; the call repeats next night.

`Replace` and `Conflict` are single steps, and `HumanEdit` is enabled only while the night waits for or holds the answer, because the hash check, the write and the commit run under the Card lock that the day writers take too (`write_card`, CORE through `writeCore`): an owner edit cannot land between the check and the write.

```sh
d=$(mktemp -d)
cp specs/NightWriter.tla specs/NightWriter.cfg "$d"/
(cd "$d" && tlc -workers 2 -config NightWriter.cfg NightWriter.tla)
```

Checked invariants:

1. `FileNeverPartial`: the visible file is always one complete old, new or owner version.
2. `ReadyOnlyAfterCommit`: a ready day has passed the commit state.
3. `HumanEditWins`: an observed owner edit is not overwritten by the night.
4. `NoSecondCall`: a restart reuses the cached answer; a second paid call happens only when the crash hit the call itself.
5. `QueueDrains`: with the stated fairness assumptions, the bounded queue reaches zero.

Mutants that must fail: the hash check removed (`HumanEditWins`), restart without the cache (`NoSecondCall`), readiness without a commit (`ReadyOnlyAfterCommit`). After a restart an uncommitted new file is committed first, before any call — the production contract of the night's opening sweep.

## Proactive

`Proactive.tla` models the half-hourly proactive run before its code exists (`scripts/proactive/tick.ts`): a no-wait lock that expires `staleMs` after it is taken, the state file `data/proactive.json` written whole from the run's memory, the Brief claim and turn, the source check, the Watch claim before the turn, delivery and the `wakes` write after it, a crash or a failed write at any step and the runner's deadline. One `Tick` is 8 minutes: a 40-minute `staleMs` gives `Stale = 5`, a run that lives at most `timeoutMs + killGraceMs` (30 min 10 s) gives `MaxRun = 4`. A comment in the model maps every action to its future file and function.

Checked invariants:

1. `NoDoubleTake`: a key reaches at most one turn between two growths of its unread count.
2. `OneBriefPerSlot`: one Brief per slot and day.
3. `WakesCapped`: ordinary wakes with a message per day stay within `watchCapPerDay` plus the number of runs lost between delivery and the `wakes` write.
4. `OneRun`: two runs never overlap.

The run takes its `now` right after the lock (`NowAfterLock = TRUE`). Witnesses must fail, each on its own invariant first: `Proactive-noclaim.cfg` (claim after the turn, 1), `Proactive-nolock.cfg` (no lock: 4, then 1, then 2), `Proactive-nocap.cfg` (no cap filter, 3), `Proactive-shortstale.cfg` (`staleMs` shorter than a run, 4), `Proactive-nowfirst.cfg` (`now` taken before the lock: a run with an older day overwrites `briefDone` written for a newer day, 2).
