# TLA+ models

The repository keeps two bounded models. Run them from a temporary directory because TLC writes state files beside the model.

## FileLock

`FileLock.tla` models the directory lock, owner token, heartbeat, stale takeover, crashes and bounded event-loop delay. The configurations vary process count, stale interval, deadline and synchronous holders:

- `FileLock.cfg`
- `FileLock-2p.cfg`
- `FileLock-deadline.cfg`
- `FileLock-hold.cfg`
- `FileLock-lag.cfg`
- `FileLock-slow.cfg`
- `FileLock-sync-slow.cfg`
- `FileLock-witness.cfg`

Example:

```sh
d=$(mktemp -d)
cp specs/FileLock.tla specs/FileLock.cfg "$d"/
(cd "$d" && tlc -workers 2 -deadlock -config FileLock.cfg FileLock.tla)
```

The model assumes that a live asynchronous holder's event loop runs often enough to refresh the lock before the stale threshold. A fully stopped process can still lose the lock after that threshold. Filesystem errors and unknown directory members are outside the model and covered by executable tests.

## NightWriter

`NightWriter.tla` models one writer under the memory lock: a model call whose answer is cached before any write, a whole-section replacement guarded by the file hash read for the call, an owner edit racing the night, commit-gated readiness, a crash at any step and restart, and an ordered queue of days. On a hash mismatch nothing is written, the answer is dropped, the Card gets `truth_pending` and the day still closes; the call repeats next night.

`Replace` and `Conflict` are single steps, and `HumanEdit` is enabled only while the night waits for or holds the answer, because the hash check, the write and the commit run under the Card lock that the day writers take too (`write_card`, CORE through `writeCore`): an owner edit cannot land between the check and the write.

```sh
d=$(mktemp -d)
cp specs/NightWriter.tla specs/NightWriter.cfg "$d"/
(cd "$d" && tlc -workers 2 -config NightWriter.cfg NightWriter.tla)
```

Checked invariants:

1. `FileNeverPartial`: the visible file is always one complete old, new or owner version.
2. `ReadyOnlyAfterCommit`: a ready day has passed the commit state.
3. `HumanEditWins`: an observed owner edit is not overwritten by the night.
4. `NoSecondCall`: a restart reuses the cached answer; a second paid call happens only when the crash hit the call itself.
5. `QueueDrains`: with the stated fairness assumptions, the bounded queue reaches zero.

Mutants that must fail: the hash check removed (`HumanEditWins`), restart without the cache (`NoSecondCall`), readiness without a commit (`ReadyOnlyAfterCommit`). After a restart an uncommitted new file is committed first, before any call — the production contract of the night's opening sweep.
