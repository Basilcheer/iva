  Send a Telegram rich-media post to ANOTHER allowlisted chat via the bot (Bot API 10.1 sendRichMessage) - text, inline images, tables, headings, lists, quotes, collapsible blocks, formulas, collages/slideshows ALL in one message bubble. Use when the owner asks to post somewhere other than the current conversation (the digest chat, for example), or when a post needs inline images between paragraphs. NOT for a report or an answer to the current chat: those are the plain reply of the turn, and the host already sends rich messages for them (see the red-banner rule in the persona).

# rich-post — Telegram rich messages via the bot

Send ONE message that mixes text, inline images, tables, headings, lists,
block quotes, collapsible blocks and formulas. This is `sendRichMessage`
(Bot API 10.1, June 2026), not an album.

## When NOT to use this

A report or an answer for the chat you are talking in is the plain reply of the
turn. The Outbox (`agent/lib/outbox.ts`) already routes a reply that needs
tables, task lists, `<details>` or block formulas into `sendRichMessage`, and
falls back to HTML if Bot API refuses it. Sending the same text with this script
instead delivers it twice and bypasses the outbound gate that runs inside the
Outbox — a secret in the text would leave unredacted. Reach for this skill only
when the destination is a different allowlisted chat, or when the post needs
inline images and the owner asked for it there.

Album (sendMediaGroup) = up to 10 media, ONE caption, no text between images.
Rich message = up to 50 media, text/tables/blocks interleaved in a single
bubble. If the user wants "картинка в середине текста" or "таблица в посте" —
this skill.

## Quick start

All paths are relative to the repo root (the agent's working directory).

```bash
python3 agent/skills/rich-post/scripts/send_rich.py --md-file /tmp/post.md
```

- Recipient: by default the message goes to `TELEGRAM_DIGEST_CHAT_ID` from
  `.env`. An explicit `--chat <id>` is accepted ONLY if the id is allowlisted
  (`TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USER_IDS` + `TELEGRAM_DIGEST_CHAT_ID`) — the recipient of
  a report is the owner's setting, not the model's choice. Anything else is
  refused without sending.
- `--md` / `--md-file` — markdown content (`--md-file -` reads stdin).
- `--dry-run` — OFFLINE check: validates the markdown and image paths, prints
  the result; nothing is uploaded or sent. Always run this first.
- `--allow-upload` — see «Local images» below. Off by default.
- `--silent`, `--thread-id` — optional.
- Token: `$TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` or the repo `.env`. There is NO `--token` flag
  (argv is visible in the process list) — don't put the token on the command line.

## Local images — read before using

Telegram accepts ONLY public URLs for rich-message media (`attach://` and
multipart upload fail with `RICH_MESSAGE_PHOTO_URL_INVALID`). So a local image
referenced as `![](file:/abs/path "caption")` must first be uploaded to a
public host. The script uses **tmpfiles.org — an anonymous PUBLIC host**:
anyone with the link can open the file while it lives there.

Because of that:

- uploads happen only with the explicit `--allow-upload` flag; without it,
  local images are an error (and `--dry-run` merely lists what WOULD be
  uploaded);
- only real media passes the gate: regular files with an image/video/audio
  extension (jpg/png/gif/webp/mp4/webm/mov/mp3/ogg/m4a), located inside the
  repo or the data dir, with no hidden dot-segment in the path. `.env`, OAuth
  json, logs, vault `.md` and any other text file are refused even with
  `--allow-upload` — a report must not be able to exfiltrate server files;
- never reference private documents as images anyway. If in doubt — don't
  upload; send text instead.

Telegram fetches and caches the media at send time, so the temp URL expiring
afterwards is fine.

## Workflow

1. **Write content** in markdown (see syntax below) to a temp file.
2. **`--dry-run`** to verify layout and image paths (offline).
3. **Send** — to the default digest chat, or an allowlisted `--chat`. For
   images add `--allow-upload` consciously (see above). Confirm with the user
   before posting anywhere beyond the current conversation.

## Limits

- 32768 UTF-8 chars total (incl. emoji alt text + formula source)
- 500 blocks (nested blocks, list items, table rows, quotes, details count)
- 16 levels of nesting
- 50 media attachments total (photos + videos + audio)
- 20 columns per table

## Gotchas (learned)

- Images need a **public URL**. `attach://` and multipart upload → 400
  `RICH_MESSAGE_PHOTO_URL_INVALID`.
- Use `rich_message.markdown` OR `rich_message.html`, exactly one.
- Channels/groups: the bot must be admin with permission to send media (and
  the target still has to be allowlisted).
- The host DOES call sendRichMessage on normal replies (`agent/lib/outbox.ts`,
  `needsRichMessage`), so tables and task lists in an ordinary answer already
  render. This script exists for the other chat, not for a nicer reply.
- The script talks to Bot API directly and runs no outbound gate. Everything it
  sends must be text you wrote in this turn, not a file dump or command output.
